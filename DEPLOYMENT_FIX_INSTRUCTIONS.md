# DEPLOYMENT FIX: Change from Static to Node.js Server

## Current Error Analysis
The deployment fails because:
- **Current Type**: Static (trying to serve files from dist/public/)
- **Error**: "could not create static deployment" 
- **Problem**: Static deployment expects just HTML/CSS/JS files, but we need a server for the media API

## EXACT FIX STEPS

### Step 1: Access Deployment Settings
1. Go to your Replit Deployments tab
2. Click on your current deployment
3. Click **"Edit commands and secrets"** 

### Step 2: Change Deployment Type  
**CRITICAL**: Change from "Static" to "Server" or "Node.js"

### Step 3: Set Commands
```
Build Command: npm ci && npm run build
Start Command: node dist/index.js  
Health Check: GET /
```

### Step 4: Deploy
Click **"Deploy"** - it will now run the Node.js server instead of serving static files

## Why This Fixes Everything

### Before (Static - BROKEN):
- Replit tries to serve `dist/public/index.html` directly
- No server running = no media API = videos fail
- Error: "could not create static deployment"

### After (Node.js Server - WORKING):
- Runs `node dist/index.js` which starts Express server
- Server serves both API (`/api/media/all`) and frontend (`dist/public/`)
- Videos work via base64 data URL system
- All 7 videos + 5 audio files load correctly

## Verification After Deploy
Once deployed with Node.js server:
1. Visit your live URL - should load Siwaht homepage
2. Check `/api/media/all` - should return JSON with video data
3. Videos should autoplay like GIFs in all sections
4. Audio players should work in Voice Synthesis and Podcast sections

The production build is ready and tested - just need to change the deployment type!
