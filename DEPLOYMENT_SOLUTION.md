# Deployment Solution for Siwaht

## Issue Identified
The deployment is configured as "static" in `.replit` but our app requires a Node.js server to serve the media API. The deployment is serving Vite development files instead of the production build.

## Solution Steps

### 1. Current Status
✅ Production build working (25MB with all media)
✅ Media API serving 7 videos + 5 audio files via data URLs
✅ Development environment working perfectly
❌ Deployment serving wrong files (Vite dev instead of production)

### 2. Root Cause
```
[deployment]
deploymentTarget = "static"
```
This configuration tells Replit to serve static files from `dist/public/` instead of running the Node.js server at `dist/index.js`.

### 3. Required Fix
The deployment needs to:
1. Run `NODE_ENV=production node dist/index.js` (our server)
2. NOT serve static files from dist/public/
3. Let the Express server handle both frontend and API routes

### 4. Temporary Workaround
Since we cannot edit `.replit`, we need to:
1. Rebuild the production bundle with `./deploy-production-ready.sh`
2. Manually deploy by clicking Deploy button
3. The deployment should automatically detect and use `dist/index.js`

### 5. Verification Commands
```bash
# Test that production build works locally
NODE_ENV=production node dist/index.js

# Test media API
curl http://localhost:5000/api/media/all

# Test frontend
curl http://localhost:5000
```

## Expected Results After Fix
- Videos display with GIF-like autoplay
- Audio players work correctly
- All media served via bulletproof data URL system
- No "Unable to load video" errors
- Professional agency presentation maintained

## Technical Details
- **Build Process**: Vite builds frontend to `dist/public/`, esbuild bundles server to `dist/index.js`
- **Media Handler**: Serves from `dist/public/videos/` and `dist/public/audio/` via base64 data URLs
- **Deployment**: Should run the Express server, not serve static files
